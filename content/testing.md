# Testing

* [ppx_expect](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_expect):
a Cram-like framework for OCaml, enabled by PPX metaprogramming.
Write some code that creates output, and then create expectation tests that match
the output against a canonical version you write.
* [craml](https://github.com/realworldocaml/craml):
another cram-like framework, this one testing the expected output of command-line
applications instead of code within OCaml.
* [Alcotest](https://github.com/mirage/alcotest):
a lightweight and colourful test framework.
* [OUnit](http://ounit.forge.ocamlcore.org/):
a unit test framework for OCaml based on HUnit,
a unit testing framework for Haskell.
It allows one to easily create unit-tests for OCaml code.
* [QCheck](https://github.com/c-cube/qcheck):
a property testing library inspired by Haskell's QuickCheck.
* [iTeML](https://github.com/vincent-hugot/iTeML): formerly known as
[qtest](http://batteries.vhugot.com/qtest/), it supports inline pragmas to generate tests.
* [Kaputt](http://kaputt.x9c.fr): a comprehensive testing framework.
* [Pa_test](https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/111.28.00/doc/pa_test):
general inline testing macros.
* [TestSimple](https://github.com/hcarty/ocaml-testsimple):
a lightweight unit testing framework
compatible with the [Test Anything Protocol](https://testanything.org/).
* [Cucumber.ml](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber.ml): Behavior Driven Development using Cucumber.
